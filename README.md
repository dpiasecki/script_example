# Script Example

This repositoty contains Bash, Python and Go versions of simple scripts that take in two numbers via the command line and add them together, and a second script that invokes the first and writes the output to a file.

To use the first script:
`bash add.sh <integer> <integer>`
or:
`python add.sh <integer> <integer>`

For the Go version you can run it with `go run add.go <integer> <integer>` or build a binary with `go build add.go` and run it with `./add <integer> <integer>`

To use the second:
`bash add.sh <integer> <integer>`
or:
`python add.sh <integer> <integer>`
the output is writen to:
total.txt
